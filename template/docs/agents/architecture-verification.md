# Spec: architecture verification

The template manages this file, and `copier update` refreshes it. It is the contract for the
`archgateCheck` build gate. An agent reads it in two cases: to adopt the gate in a project that does not
have it yet (section 3), and to fix a finding the gate reports (section 4).

## 1. Intent

Code review used to be the only place that caught project contracts, such as a test class that TestNG never
runs or a `System.out` call in framework code. `archgateCheck` checks them on every build with the
[ArchGate](https://github.com/quokkify/archgate) Gradle plugin `dev.quokkify.archgate`: rules listed in a
plain text file, one report. A finding at `ERROR` fails `./gradlew check`.

## 2. Requirements

Each requirement can be checked with a file read or a command.

| ID  | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Check                                                    |

| R1  | The Gradle wrapper is 9.7.1 or later, the oldest version the plugin supports.                                                                                                                                                  | read `distributionUrl` in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` |
| R2  | `gradle/libs.versions.toml` declares the `archgate` version, the library `archgate-bom` (`dev.quokkify.archgate:archgate-bom`, `version.ref = "archgate"`) and the plugin `archgate` (`dev.quokkify.archgate`, `version.ref = "archgate"`). | read the three tables                                    |
| R3  | `build.gradle` applies `alias(libs.plugins.archgate)` and sets `archgate { rootPackage = '<package_root>.<package_name>'; failOn = 'ERROR' }` from `.copier-answers.yml`.                                                     | read `build.gradle`                                      |
| R4  | `gradle/dependencies.gradle` declares `testImplementation platform(libs.archgate.bom)` and `testImplementation 'dev.quokkify.archgate:archgate-rules-archunit'`.                                                              | read `dependencies { }`                                  |
| R5  | `src/test/resources/META-INF/services/dev.quokkify.archgate.api.ArchitectureRule` lists at least the six rules in section 4.                                                                                                   | read the file                                            |
| R6  | `./gradlew check` runs `archgateCheck`, and CI runs `check` or `archgateCheck` on every pull request.                                                                                                                           | `./gradlew check --dry-run \| grep archgateCheck`        |
| R7  | A finding is fixed in the code. Never remove a rule, never lower the gate with `failOn`, `-Parchgate.failOn` or `-Parchgate.skip`, and never take `archgateCheck` out of `check` to make a build pass.                       | review the diff of `build.gradle` and the services file  |
| R8  | Nothing of the old q4j gate is left: no `gradle/architecture.gradle`, `tools/architecture/`, `verifyArchitecture`, `architecture.packages`, or `q4j-architecture` catalog entry.                                             | section 3, step 1                                        |

The rules run only when the services file lists them (opt-in), and a public rule class in the project that
the file does not list fails the build (fail-closed). To change a built-in rule's parameter or severity,
subclass it and list the subclass instead of the original; build settings do not configure rules. Rules
specific to this project belong in a `<project>-archgate-rules` module, not in the template files. The
plugin documentation explains both: [configuration](https://github.com/quokkify/archgate/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
and [writing a rule](https://github.com/quokkify/archgate/blob/main/docs/extending.md).

## 3. Adoption procedure

Run it when `build.gradle` does not apply `libs.plugins.archgate`. Only a new project gets the gate wired.
In an existing project, `copier update` adds the services file and refreshes this spec. It does not change
`build.gradle`, `gradle/dependencies.gradle` or the version catalog, because those belong to the project
after the first generation. `<ref>` below is the `_commit` value of `.copier-answers.yml`, the template
version that delivered this file. If that value is not a release tag (it then looks like
`v2.0.0-3-gabc1234`), use the latest release tag of the template instead.

An update from a template version before 2.0.0 also runs a Copier migration, which Copier runs only with
`copier update --trust`. The migration removes the old q4j gate (step 1) and nothing else.

1. Remove the old q4j gate (R8), if any of it is left. The migration does this; check it, and do by hand
   what is still there:
   - delete the line `apply from: 'gradle/architecture.gradle'` from `build.gradle`;
   - delete `gradle/architecture.gradle` and the `tools/architecture/` directory;
   - delete `architecture.packages` and `architecture.fail.on` from `gradle.properties`, and the file if
     nothing else is left in it;
   - delete `q4j-architecture`, `log4j-core` and `log4j-slf4j2-impl` from `[libraries]` of
     `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, and `log4j` from `[versions]`, unless another build script uses them.

   Then run `./gradlew assemble testClasses`, and fix what fails before you go on.
2. Check the wrapper (R1). If it is older than 9.7.1, run
   `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <the version in template/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties at <ref>>`.
3. Add to `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (R2), after the existing entries of each table. Take the version from
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quokkify/java-test-automation-template/<ref>/template/gradle/libs.versions.toml`:

   ```toml
   [versions]
   archgate = "<version>"

   [libraries]
   archgate-bom = { module = "dev.quokkify.archgate:archgate-bom", version.ref = "archgate" }

   [plugins]
   archgate = { id = "dev.quokkify.archgate", version.ref = "archgate" }
   ```

4. In `build.gradle` (R3), add `alias(libs.plugins.archgate)` as the last line of the `plugins { }` block,
   and append this block after the `apply from` lines. `<base>` is `<package_root>.<package_name>` from
   `.copier-answers.yml`:

   ```groovy
   archgate {
       rootPackage = '<base>'
       failOn = 'ERROR'
   }
   ```

5. Add to the `dependencies { }` block of `gradle/dependencies.gradle` (R4):

   ```groovy
   testImplementation platform(libs.archgate.bom)
   testImplementation 'dev.quokkify.archgate:archgate-rules-archunit'
   ```

6. Check that `src/test/resources/META-INF/services/dev.quokkify.archgate.api.ArchitectureRule` exists (R5).
   If it does not, copy it from
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quokkify/java-test-automation-template/<ref>/template/src/test/resources/META-INF/services/dev.quokkify.archgate.api.ArchitectureRule`.
7. Run `./gradlew archgateCheck`. Fix every `ERROR` finding as section 4 describes, then fix the `WARNING`
   findings or list them in the change description. A run without findings needs nothing more.
8. Make sure CI runs `check` or `archgateCheck` (R6). If CI runs only named tasks, such as
   `assemble testClasses checkstyleMain`, add `archgateCheck` to that list, in place of `verifyArchitecture`
   if it is there. If the project has no CI configuration, the CI half of R6 does not apply; say so in the
   change description.
9. Check every box in section 5 before you hand the change over.

## 4. Rules and fixes

`MAIN` means the classes of `src/main`. `TEST` means the classes of `src/test`. The report prints this scope
next to each rule. Every rule is in `dev.quokkify.archgate.rules.archunit`, and its page in the
[ArchGate rule docs](https://github.com/quokkify/archgate/tree/main/docs/rules) shows a violation and a fix.

| Rule                         | Scope     | Severity | Finding means                                                                                                                                         | Fix                                                                                         |

| `ServiceRegistrationRule`    | MAIN+TEST | ERROR    | A `META-INF/services` file names a type that cannot be loaded, or a provider that does not implement the service, is not a public concrete class, or has no public no-argument constructor. | Fix the provider class or the registration line.                                            |
| `TestClassNamingRule`        | TEST      | ERROR    | A class with TestNG `@Test` methods has a name that does not end in `Test`, so name-based test selection skips it.                                  | Rename the class, or move shared code into a support class without `@Test` methods.         |

A run that cannot verify anything fails whatever `failOn` says, for example when no class is compiled under
`rootPackage` or no TestNG test class exists. Fix the cause the error message names. The report is also
written to `build/reports/archgate/report.txt`; read it when the task is `UP-TO-DATE` or `FROM-CACHE`, because
the console report is printed only when the task runs.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] R1 to R6 and R8 hold.
- [ ] `./gradlew archgateCheck` prints `Gate PASSED`.
- [ ] `./gradlew check --dry-run` lists `:archgateCheck` (a dry run prints every task as `SKIPPED`).
- [ ] The diff does not remove rules already listed in the services file, and does not add `failOn` values
      other than `ERROR`, `archgate.failOn` or `archgate.skip` anywhere (R7).
